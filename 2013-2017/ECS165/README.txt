Please use the command “start_postgres” first and than run the shell script file “hw4.sh” by type in ./hw4.sh
We also have a drop_table() function prepared. If any external problem happened and end the program early, the drop_table() function can be used to drop the exist table to avoid the problem that the table will be already exist when rerunning the program. If not all the table are needed to be dropped, you can command out the tables that do not exist.
And then end up with “stop_postgres”. 

Thank you for your time.
