c) Short Description:

    Determine a person's gender as male or female from their voice seems to be ituitive to a human.  However, we are not certained about how we detect the difference between a male or female. So our group are interested in teaching machine to learn about this technique and reveal what actually determine one's gender based on the voice. We will analyze speech from  sources like Festvox CMU_ARCTIC Speech Database at Carnegie Mellon University. We then use R to process these voice file and using machine learning skill to teach the computer. We might also explore more hidden relationship to distinguish Human Voice and Non-Human voice.


Yours Sincerely,
Haozhe Gu

Approved. Make sure that you have a clean dataset with clear labels, sufficient features and run the audio decomposition algorithms early on. You should be able to get more than 90% performance (AUPR).
